# Pybarsys settings
## General
The settings of pybarsys (and related Django settings like for email or static files) are stored in a `.env` file.
A template of this file is provided to you as `.env.example` - you can just copy it, rename it to `.env`, and modify or add settings.

A valid `.env` file should look similar to this:

```dotenv
# Comment
NAME="Pete Multicity"
NAME_TWO=Jessica Monorail
VALUE_ONE=1
VALUE_TWO=2.0
```

Note that all lines, except comments, have the structure `PARAMETER_NAME=VALUE_YOU_WANT` without any spaces next to the `=`.
Strings can be enclosed with apostrophes, but it is important that you do NOT add a comment into a line that's also supposed to be a definition (as `django-environ` will parse everything to the right as part of the string...):
```dotenv
## BAD:
NAME="Pete Multicity" # commenting here will be an issue

## GOOD:
# Commenting in an extra line is fine
NAME_TWO="Jessica Monorail"

## ALSO GOOD:
# Apostrophes for strings are not necessary with django-environ - maybe it's even better this way because you're less likely to mistakenly add a comment to a line like this?
NAME_THREE=Sri Unquoted Mueller
```

## Database and email URLs

The configuration of the database connection and email server must be supplied as URLs.
Some examples can be found in [the `django-environ` documentation](https://django-environ.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#supported-types).

It is important that special characters in these URLs are encoded.
If e.g. the username for the database connections is `user` and the password is `hunter2!"ยง$%&/()=?`, the encoded form of the password can be found like this:

```python
>>> import urllib.parse
>>> urllib.parse.quote('hunter2!"ยง$%&/()=?')
'hunter2%21%22%C2%A7%24%25%26/%28%29%3D%3F'
```

The `DATABASE_URL` could then possibly be defined like this:
```dotenv
DATABASE_URL=mysql://user:hunter2%21%22%C2%A7%24%25%26/%28%29%3D%3F@localhost:3306/database22
```

The same goes for `EMAIL_URL`.

## Required settings
These settings MUST be set in your `.env` file. If your secret key starts with a '$' you need to escape it with a backslash '\$', otherwise Django-environ will interpret it as en environment variable.
